# Stellar modelisation

In the context of the final project of our Master's degree in Marine Physics, we are expected to produce an experimental research applied on Fluid Mechanics, using our acquired knowlegde until now. For this reason, the chosen subject is centered around numerical modelisation and fluid variations of the solar magma. The aim of this study is to reach an efficient model of our Sun by simulation and comparison using astronomical knowledge in addition.
